Plot both the original shot data and the interpolated time series."

Start with $\\Delta x=1.2$ and keep halving until the relative difference between solutions falls below $1.0^{-6}$ Plot the convergence of the method, i.e. plot $\\Delta x$ against the absolute difference between the analytical value and the finite difference approximation."
